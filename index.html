                <p>The term "eye" typically refers to the organ that detects light and is responsible for vision in humans and many animals. The human eye is a complex sensory organ that gathers light and converts it into electrical signals, which are then transmitted to the brain for visual perception.
                    The human eye consists of several parts, including the cornea, lens, retina, iris, and optic nerve. These components work together to focus light onto the retina, where specialized cells called photoreceptors convert the light into electrical signals. These signals are then transmitted to the brain through the optic nerve, allowing us to perceive the surrounding world.
                    Eyes come in various shapes, sizes, and colors across different species, and they play a crucial role in the sensory perception of the environment.

                <p>The mouth is the part of the body used for eating, speaking, and tasting. It helps with the initial digestion of food through chewing and produces saliva to aid in the process. The tongue in the mouth is responsible for sensing different flavors. Additionally, the mouth is crucial for speech and maintaining oral health through proper dental care.</p>
